## Development
While doing my apprenticeship, I built an android health application that used Google Maps API to recommend healthy meals from local restaurants in NYC. As part of planning I wanted to add cardio data like a fitness tracker but the idea was scraped due to time constraints and app functionality. Hence, I created this website that does just that.
